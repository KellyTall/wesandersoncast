A lightweight R package that provides a tidy dataset of actors appearing in films directed by **Wes Anderson**, including the year of release, duration in minutes, and worldwide box office takings — all sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/).

The dataset is ideal for demonstrations, tutorials, and exploration of network relationships or filmography trends using the tidyverse.

## 📦 Dataset contents

The `wes_actors` dataset is a tibble with the following columns:

The `wes_actors` dataset is a tibble with 353 rows and 5 variables:

| Column           | Type     | Description                                                |
|------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `film`     | character | Title of the film directed by Wes Anderson                 |
| `actor`    | character | Name of the actor appearing in the film                   |
| `release_date`   | date      | Official release date of the film                         |
| `box_office_usd`     | numeric   | Worldwide box office gross (in USD, where available)      |
| `duration_period`| lubridate Period | Duration of the film in hours and minutes (e.g. "1H 45M") |

## Data Notes

*"Castello Cavalcanti", "Cousin Ben Troop Screening with Jason Schwartzman", "Hotel Chevalier", and short versions of "Bottle Rocket" are not included.
*"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar", "The Rat Catcher", and "The Swan" have no Box Office results as they were produced by Netflix.
*"The Phoenician Scheme" was released in May 2025, and at the time of publishing this to CRAN, there were no Box Office figures available. I will update once this info is available.

If you find any errors in the data, I encourage you to correct them on Wikidata. It's an incredible resource that relies on input by people like you. 

## License

The dataset included in this package is dedicated to the public domain under [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of wesandersoncast like so:

```r
# If on GitHub:
# remotes::install_github("yourusername/wesandersoncast")

# Or install from local source (if not yet on CRAN):
devtools::install()
## Example
```

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(wesandersoncast)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
